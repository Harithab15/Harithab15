### About Me


I bridge the world of **networking and cybersecurity**  passionate about how data moves and how attackers exploit it. I enjoy configuring OSPF one day, analyzing Splunk logs the next, and automating firewall rules in between.

My goal is to become the kind of engineer who not only knows how to route packets, but also how to defend them.

 Every packet tells a story. The job is to know when it’s the beginning of an attack.
